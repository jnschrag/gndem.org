For instance, the web server may record the numerical Internet Protocol address of your computer; information about your browser and operating system; date and time of access; and the Internet address and page that linked (referred) you to our site.

## Cookie Policy

GNDEM websites use web cookies — small data files that are placed on the user’s device by which a website and a web browser can jointly “remember” information within or between browsing sessions. Cookies are useful because they can improve the user experience. However, cookies also have been subject to criticism because they can be used to invisibly assemble information about a user’s browsing habits for marketing purposes.

GNDEM uses cookies to improve the user experience within the context of a single browser session or between site visits. Cookies may contain a “key” so that users do not need to login every time a new page is visited, or when returning to the GNDEM website from the same computer at a later date.

* for site operation, for example to enable a user to access and update address information for our mailing list or a CV if it was submitted to apply for a vacancy;
* to analyse use of the site by, for example, recognizing and counting the number of visitors and how they move around the site.This helps GNDEM to see what parts of our site are popular and which sections may need improving to make the experience better for users; and
* to record the user’s visit to the site and the pages visited as well the links followed.We will use this to make the site more relevant to your interests.
