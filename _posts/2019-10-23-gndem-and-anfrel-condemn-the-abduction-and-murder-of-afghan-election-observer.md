The Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) and the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) condemn the abduction and murder of Shaheed Ali Naqi. Reports indicate that the Taliban abducted Shaheed a few days after Afghanistan’s September 28 presidential election as he was completing observation efforts. He was later found murdered. Shaheed was a youth member of the Afghan Civil Society Forum Organization (ACSFo), a nonpartisan group that works for the inclusion of civil society in bringing stability, peace, reconstruction and development to Afghanistan.

ACSFo and other Afghan nonpartisan groups mobilized over 7,000 citizen election observers across the country’s 34 provinces for the presidential election as part of citizens’ demonstrating their will for democratic government that respects people’s fundamental human rights. Shaheed’s murder along with other heinous attacks cannot diminish that will.

GNDEM and ANFREL extend sympathies to Shaheed’s family and colleagues and joins calls for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. We urge the Afghan authorities to do everything in their power to protect those in their country who engage in elections and broader democratic processes.
